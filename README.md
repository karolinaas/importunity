# About Importunity
Copyright 2024 [NXP](https://www.nxp.com/)

Importunity is a simple Zephyr module that provides integration with [Unity Test](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) framework.
It differs itself from other similar projects (Such as [Antmicro's great module](https://github.com/antmicro/zephyr-cmock-unity-module)) by not requiring Ruby as it does not make use of any of Unity's optional helper scripts.
This makes using Importunity super simple and suitable for Unity beginners.
